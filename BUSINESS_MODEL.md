# Business Model
Here are the multitude of things that we want to eventually do; and hopefully this is what the record labels would be willing to pay for

#### Metrics
Numbers and statistics regarding the artist's current and historical performance
- initially we would want to gather as much data as we can about prominent artists, historical or otherwise
- imagine a dashboard for the artist's career "health"
- compare and contrast hundreds of data points

#### Artists and Repertoire (A&R)
Digitally scout and for talents (Emerging Artists)
- after gaining a better understanding of the music industry on the rise and fall of music legends, we hopefully should have a better insight on spotting up-and-coming artists
