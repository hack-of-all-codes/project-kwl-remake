# Remake: KWL Project
Got bored today and decided to make some Evil Plans for Remaking the KWL Project from the ground up.

## Wishlist: Data Harvesting
- Create separate Spring Boot modules for each type of harvesting
- Use Spring Boot + Whatever Framework for scraping sites (check out Nutch)
- Scraper should harvest and store data without processing its contents

## Wishlist: Data Processing
- Use Spring Cloud Dataflow instead of Pentaho
- Use a Spark Cluster for Stream Processing
- Use a Hadoop Cluster for large batch jobs

## Wishlist: Platform
- Use Spring Boot as the main framework
- Separate Master Data and Metrics

## Wishlist: Front End
- Use ReactJS + Flux instead of Angular as the app framework
